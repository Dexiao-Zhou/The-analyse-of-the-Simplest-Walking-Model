# The-analyse-of-the-Simplest-Walking-Model
This report presents a detailed simulation and analysis of a model of an inverted pendulum walking on a slope. This model abstracts the complex of human gait into a bipedal system of point masses and rigid rods. The model allows insight into the system dynamics and stability characteristics of walking. 

This report is divided into two parts, one is Latex's report file and the other is Matlab code file, which contains simulations of the walking models. Readers can first read the report file in the Latex folder, which will help with the understanding of the Matlab code.
