# The-analyse-of-the-Simplest-Walking-Model
This report presents a detailed simulation and analysis of a model of an inverted pendulum walking on a slope. This model abstracts the complex of human gait into a bipedal system of point masses and rigid rods. The model allows insight into the system dynamics and stability characteristics of walking.
